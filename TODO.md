# iCUE widgets — TODO

## C64 Weather — 1.2.0

### Done

- [x] **Sunrise / sunset, wind, high / low.** All three requested additions are
      rendered. Sun times are taken as an `HH:MM` substring of the ISO string,
      not parsed into a `Date` — `timezone=auto` already returns them in the
      location's own timezone, so parsing would re-shift them into ours. Wind
      follows the temperature unit: `13KM/H` beside °C, `8MPH` beside °F.
- [x] **Three-column readout**, after the arrangement of Corsair's stock weather
      widget: temperature and place left, condition sprite with the day's
      low/high beneath it centre, timed readings right. Each right-hand row is
      an 8×8 glyph plus a value, drawn on the same cell as the font.
- [x] **Everything fits the smallest slot.** The three columns fit 840×344 with
      room over, so no column is dropped for width; only `FEELS` and `HUM` are
      conditional.

Detail shown per slot:

| Slot | Right column |
|---|---|
| 840×344, 696×416 and up | `UP` `DN` `WIND` |
| ≥600px tall | plus `FEELS` |
| ≥1000px wide | plus `HUM` |

The condition sprite is already weather-driven — sun, moon, partly, cloud, fog,
drizzle, rain, snow, thunderstorm — with a palette colour per condition.

### Open

- [ ] Nothing outstanding.

## Claude Code Usage — 1.2.0

### Done

- [x] **Calibrated the budgets** (2026-08-28) against the real usage panel, using
      `/usage?at=<timestamp>` for a same-moment comparison. Session 54M, weekly
      178M standard, with the +50% promotional boost declared separately so it
      expires on its own.
- [x] **Autostart.** `ClaudeUsageFeed` scheduled task runs `start-hidden.vbs` at
      logon; verified by killing the server and letting the task restart it with
      no console window.
- [x] **`translation.json` format.** Was a flat map, which iCUE reads as a map of
      *languages*; now nested under `en.translation` per `docs/translations.md`
      and Corsair's own bundled widgets.
- [x] **Version and last-updated in the header.** The timestamp is the feed's
      `generatedAt`, and turns amber after three missed refresh cycles so a dead
      feed is distinguishable from live numbers that are not moving.
- [x] **Tap to switch views** — usage bars ↔ activity (sessions, workflows,
      subtasks), with a two-dot indicator.
- [x] **Scrollable lists**, replacing the row trimming that made anything past
      the first handful unreachable. Headings carry totals, a fade marks an
      overflowing list, and scroll position survives a refresh.

### Open

- [ ] **Confirm touch drag works on the device.** Scrolling is verified in a
      browser, but `interactive` is documented only as enabling *click*
      handling — whether the iCUE webview forwards drags is unknown. If it does
      not, page the lists on a timer instead.
- [ ] **Confirm the weekly anchor.** Thu 21:00 local, taken from the usage panel.
      Verify against a real weekly reset.
- [ ] **Re-check the calibration after August 31**, when the +50% weekly boost
      ends. The expiry is already in `limits.json`, so this is a verification
      rather than a change.
- [ ] **The Fable weekly bar is not calibrated** — there was no Fable usage to
      compare against, so its budget is only scaled from the original guess.

## Both widgets

- [ ] **tab-buttons throws in iCUE's settings panel:**
      `TabButtonsEditorSetting.qml:33: TypeError: Property 'rowCount' of object
      [object Object],[object Object],[object Object] is not a function`. Fires
      for C64 Weather's `tempUnit` and the usage widget's `colorTheme`. It is in
      iCUE's own QML, so it may be their bug rather than a malformed
      `data-values` — not yet investigated.

## Notes for future work

- **Re-importing a `.icuewidget` mints a new registration** under a fresh GUID in
  `%APPDATA%\Corsair\CUE5\html_widgets\` and leaves the old one behind, unplaced.
  Removing a widget from the dashboard deletes its folder, so remove-then-re-add
  is the clean way to reload; re-importing is what accumulates duplicates.
- **Widget properties reset on re-add** — `cityName` goes back to Copenhagen
  every time.
- **iCUE caches the loaded page.** Updating files on disk does nothing until the
  widget is removed and re-added; the version in the header is the quickest way
  to tell which build is actually running.
- **Headless Chrome's `--window-size` includes window chrome** — see the
  verification section in `README.md` before trusting any layout screenshot.
